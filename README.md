This script processes Force-Distance Optical Tweezers data in an automated way, to find unfolding events.

The script is developed to handle h5 raw data, produced by the C-Trap OT instrument from LUMICKS,

as well as any other FD data prepared in a CSV file (2 columns: Force(pN) - Distance(um))

Furthermore the script can analyse single constant force markers.

The parameters can be changed in the GUI before each run.

Alternatively they can be changed permanently in the POTATO_config file.
